# Challenge: Calculate the Split
#
# 1. Calculate service_charge_total. The user enters a whole number percentage,
#    so you'll need to convert it to a decimal and multiply it by cost to get the dollar amount.
#    Save the result to service_charge_total. Check the hints.md file if you're unsure about the math!

event = input("What was the event or occasion? ")
cost = float(input("How much was it? "))
service_charge = int(input("Was there a tip or a service charge? Enter a whole number (e.g. 20 for 20%): "))
group_size = int(input("How many people were in your group? "))

service_charge_total = cost * service_charge / 100
#
# 2. Add cost and service_charge_total to get the grand total.
#    Save it to grand_total.

grand_total = cost + service_charge_total

# 3. Divide grand_total by group_size to get total_per_person.

total_per_person = grand_total / group_size

print("Welcome to PayUp!")
print()
print(f"Here's the breakdown for {event}:")
print()
print(f"Cost: ${cost}")
print(f"Service charges: ${service_charge_total}")
print(f"Group size: {group_size}")
print(f"Grand total: ${grand_total}")
print()
print(f"Each person must PayUp: ${total_per_person}")
