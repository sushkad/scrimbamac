# 1. Add new print statement - on a new line
#    which says 'We hear you like the color xxx! xxx is a string with color
# 2. extend the function with another  input parameter 'color', that defaults to 'red'
# 3. Capture the color via an input box as variable:color
# 4. Change the 'You are xx!' text to say 'you will be xx+1 years old next birthday
#  adding 1 to the age
# 5. Capitalize first letter of the 'name', and rest are small caps
